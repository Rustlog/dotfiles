Why do we need to write comments?
    Because in future (if by chance) your code is broken, needs fixing, or requires refactoring.
    Someone has to touch your code, read it, understand your intent, logic, and syntax
    and start working on code. Assume there are no comments. No problem - you will still
    be able to understand it, but it may take longer than it should. It's harder to read
    and wastes time spent on figuring out how it works. The time worked on code could
    have been spent on another piece of code; for example fix code or adding a new feature.
    We may write comments for your future self, but future self doesn't know about current
    self, so comments are your ways to negotiate or express intent with your future self
    or others (Write good comments).

How to write comments?
    Start expressing your code's intent not what it does, think in terms of your intent and
    behaviour instead of spilling out a another pseudo-code block in comment form.
